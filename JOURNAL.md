# June 9th: Began to create a list of goals for the project

I created a list of 10 objectives, and began to create subcategories under them after a bit of research into parsing methods.

**Total time spent: 1h**


# June 16th: Completed breakdown of objectives

I completed all the subcategories for the breakdown of my different objectives, and did research into the algorithms and maths needed, and the hardware components needed.
