# June 9th: Began to create a list of goals for the project

I created a list of 10 objectives, and began to create subcategories under them after a bit of research into parsing methods.

**Total time spent: 1h**


# June 16th: Completed breakdown of objectives

I completed all the subcategories for the breakdown of my different objectives, and did research into the algorithms and maths needed, and the hardware components needed. I have uploaded my complete objectives breakdown and current list of links to this repository.

# June 23rd: Started modelling algorithms needed, and created a form for requirements gathering

I created a list of algorithms to explain, and started to create a plan for them. I also created a Microsoft Form asking people about their experiences with calculators, in order to get ideas and see what people wanted.
